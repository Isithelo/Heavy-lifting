<h3> 
Use Heavy-lifting to build, design and create projects, support your business, and work together on <strong>open source </strong> engineering databases.

<p>It is possible the frame work would work as a CMS system.</p>

Based on <a href="https://github.com/sahat/megaboilerplate">Mega Boilerplate</a>.

Port is set to 5000.
Designed to imitate GitHub

<h3>Introduction.</h3>

<h5>Heavy-lifting is a method of using forms to record data in a systematic fashion.</h5> 

<p>In the engineering environment, there is a requirement to catalogue vast amounts of information. This information ranges from commercial contracts through to tables of bolts sizes. All of which would eventually be used for the reporting of data to a client or employer.  
The cataloguing of this data is currently contained in standards and specifications spread out across the globe. These specifications are generally controlled by standards bodies which in turn commercialize the documentation. This commercialization fundamentally impleads the growth of new industries and creates barriers to entry to globalization of trade. 
Included in this is vast amounts of duplication and erroneous mistakes that are not changes for years. </p>
<h5>Heavy-lifting aims to improve this through shared data control.</h5>
<p>At the core of the design of Heavy-lifting are the following considerations: </p>
<ul>
<li>Record changes in data over time, <li>
<li>provide access to vast amounts of peer review information to all users, <li>
<li>build component and assembly structures, <li>
<li>have an open data structure which can be modular in nature.<li>
</ul>

<h3>Installation instructions.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Step 1 - Install Node.js</li>
<li>Step 2 - Install mongdb | follow the set up instructions on the website. (the trick is to create the c:/data/db directory then run mongod.exe)</li>
<li>Step 3 - Sign up for Github , install the windows gihub client , clone the repository.</li>
<li>Step 4 - The node.js installation allowed for the installation of the NPM service  , go into the directory where heavy-lifting was cloned using your preferred command prompt (DOS) and type <pre>npm install npm@latest -g</pre> , this should be typed into your preferred command prompt package. NPM will now download and install into the cloned directory. If this does not work , try install again using : <pre>npm install</pre></li>
<li>Step 5 - in order to bring in the favicon server , use the cmd prompt to install <pre>npm install serve-favicon</pre></li>
<li>Step 6 - to make life much easier , install nodemon. Nodemon restarts the server on crash , type into the cmd prompt <pre>npm install -g nodemon</pre></li>
<li>Step 7 - in order to communicate between the mongo server and the client side , expressjs needs to be installed. type into the cmd prompt <pre>npm install express</pre></li>
<li>Step 8 - Robomongo is a very useful tool for viewing the mongodb database structure. Install from their website.<a  href="https://robomongo.org/" target="_blank">Robomongo</a></li>
